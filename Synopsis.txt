EXPECTED GOALS
Synopsis:

Expected goals (or xG) measures the quality of a chance by calculating the likelihood that it will be scored from a particular position 
on the pitch during a particular phase of play. For example, Ronaldo scoring a goal from outside the 6-yard box against Manchester City could be 0.75.
Higher the xG, higher the chance of the goal being scored. An xG of one cannot exist as no shot taken in football is 100% guaranteed.
xG measures the probability that a shot will result in a goal based on a number of factors. 
Such factors include the distance from where the shot was taken, angle with respect to the goal line, the game state (what is the score), if it was a header, if the shot came during a counter attack and other factors. 
For the purpose of simplicity, our exploration will focus on just three of these factors.
